After loading image run this command in docker:

	docker-machine stop default

Open up VM ware. Go into settings of default machine.
Set up rules for port forwarding.

	Name	Protocol	HostIP		HostPort	GuestIp		GuestPort
	Django	TCP		127.0.0.1	8000				8000

Run these docker commands:

	docker-machine start default
	docker-machine env default

Look at last line that says how to configure shell
Copy that command and run. Mine looked like this:

	eval $("D:\Docker Toolbox\docker-machine.exe" env default)

Run the image with this command:

	docker run -it -p 8000:8000 test

Inside container run these commands:

	service mysql start
	python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

You will now be able to access the swagger of the django in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or localhost:8000
Can use this endpoint to gather data from the database stored in the container


New commands:

    Connect to running mysql instance in docker:
    	    mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u APIUser -p
